## Description
This analysis compares the levelized cost of hydrogen production of the steam methane reforming and water electrolysis process. For this purpose, Germanyâ€™s national strategy for producing hydrogen via electrolysis capacity of 5 GW by 2030 is modeled on Python.

## Tasks
- Quantifying the economic viability of hydrogen production methods: Modeled and simulated the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) using Python, comparing steam methane reforming and water electrolysis to identify the most cost-effective option.
- Analyzing the impact of renewables on hydrogen production: Determined the share of renewables in the electricity generation mix, via linear regression, and assessed its influence on the environmental footprint of hydrogen production.
- Evaluating carbon pricing strategies for clean hydrogen: Calculated carbon dioxide emissions associated with different production methods and proposed a carbon price that incentivizes the use of renewable energy sources for hydrogen generation.
