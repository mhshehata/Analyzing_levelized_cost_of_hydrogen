#Description:
This analysis compares the levelized cost of hydrogen production of the steam methane reforming and water electrolysis process. For this purpose, Germany’s national strategy for producing hydrogen via electrolysis capacity of 5 GW by 2030 is modeled on Python.

#Tasks:
Quantifying the economic viability of hydrogen production methods: Modeled and simulated the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) using Python, comparing steam methane reforming and water electrolysis to identify the most cost-effective option.
Analyzing the impact of renewables on hydrogen production: Determined the share of renewables in the electricity generation mix, via linear regression, and assessed its influence on the environmental footprint of hydrogen production.
Evaluated carbon pricing strategies for clean hydrogen: Calculated carbon dioxide emissions associated with different production methods and proposed a carbon price that incentivizes the use of renewable energy sources for hydrogen generation.
